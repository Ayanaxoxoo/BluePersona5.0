    <h1 class="heading">Who am I?</h1>
<p class="text">My name is Ayana, and I attend the International School Almere, currently in MYP5. This year, I'm embarking on an important journey, the Personal Project, which is a mandatory component of my academic year. 

    The project serves as a culmination of everything I’ve learned so far, pushing me to explore new ideas, challenge myself, and create something meaningful. It’s an opportunity to dive deeper into a topic that resonates with me personally, encouraging growth and self-reflection. The Personal Project isn’t just about completing an assignment, it’s about discovering my passions, sharpening my skills, and preparing for future challenges as I take on more responsibilities in my academic and personal life.</p>
